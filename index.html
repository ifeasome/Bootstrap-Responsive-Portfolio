       <h1>Who am I</h1>
       <p> I work with languages: human and computers. With human languages, I can lay claim to
           three and a half. But with computer, well, let me start by listing them: HTML, CSS, 
           Python, Java, Ruby, JavaScript, SQL, PHP, Swift, C#, C++, and SQL. I and computers just seem 
           to speak the same language. 
       </p>
       <p> 
           On the human side of things, I do communicate in a number of ways. Reading, watching movies, 
           cooking, hiking, going out, walking... Some of these I do with people.
